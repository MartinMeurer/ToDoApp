<h1>ToDo App</h1>

<p>A full implementation in HTML / CSS and JavaScript. The list is dynamically built by JS code via DOM.</p>

<p>It also saves the list to disk via LocalStorage, so it stays persistent between sessions.</p>

<p>It has thorough Sanity Checks, Exception & Error Handling for the user input.</p>

<p>There are subtle conveniences built into the behavior, via pre-emptive focus on relevant input fields<br>
 and keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing Enter instead clicking Button, and Escape to leave Edit mode.</p>
